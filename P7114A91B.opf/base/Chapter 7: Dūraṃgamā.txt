The Seventh Ground: Far Progressed

Now, in terms of the seventh resolve it was said:On Far Progressed the bodhisattvas can engageCessation
in each moment, and they now attainA brilliant perfection in their skilful means.
(7.1)To engage cessation refers to entering into the state of the final goal, meaning
cessation into ultimate reality where all mental elaboration ceases. The bodhisattvas on the
seventh ground, Far Progressed, now enter into the cessation they achieved on the sixth
ground in each moment. As stated:O heirs of the Victor, from the sixth bodhisattva ground
onwards they settle within the state of cessation of bodhisattvas. In each moment of mind
the bodhisattvas established on this seventh bodhisattva ground enter into and emerge from
the state of cessation, but this cannot be described as the definitive experience of cessation.1Their
perfection of skilful means is also utterly purified.It should be taken into
consideration that skilful means, aspiration, power and wisdom are in fact particular aspects
of intelligence (prajñā) itself, and that in the context of the perfection of intelligence
it is solely the intelligence of analytical investigation that is dealt with, and not
the others.

This was the seventh resolve from the Commentary to Entering the Middle Way.
