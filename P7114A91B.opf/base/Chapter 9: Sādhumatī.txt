The Ninth Ground: Perfect Intellect

In terms of the ninth resolve it was said:Upon the ninth their power is complete and pure in
every way,And likewise fully pure their qualities of perfect intellect. (9.1)On the ninth
bodhisattva ground the bodhisattvasâ€™ perfection of power is fully purified, and they achieve
the four pure qualities of perfect intellect: a detailed knowledge of things, meaning,
interpretation and eloquence. (1) The detailed knowledge of things is to understand the defining
characteristics of all phenomena. (2) The detailed knowledge of meaning is to understand
the classifications of all phenomena. (3) The detailed knowledge of interpretation
is to understand how to express things clearly. (4) The detailed knowledge of eloquence is
to have an uninterrupted understanding of the relevant causes of phenomena.The explanation
of the ninth resolve has thus been completed.

This was the ninth resolve from the Commentary to Entering the Middle Way.
