The Tenth Ground: Cloud of Dharma

In terms of the tenth resolve it was said:Upon them on the tenth ground every buddha now bestows
supremeEmpowerment, and through their wisdom they now reach supremacy.Then from these
victor’s heirs spontaneous rains of Dharma shower down,Like torrents from the clouds, so
beings’ crops of virtue may increase. (10.1)The bodhisattvas on the tenth bodhisattva ground
are empowered by the illustrious buddhas, as stated:When ten incalculable meditative concentrations
come to an end, a concentration called Empowered to be indistinguishable from
the wisdom of omniscience develops for the bodhisattva. As soon as this happens, a giant
jewel lotus the size of a million trichiliocosms inlaid with all kinds of precious jewels
…, and surrounded by as many lotuses as there are minute particles in ten incalculable trichiliocosms.
The bodhisattva then comes to rest, seated there in a body that corresponds.
As soon as he attains this concentration and appears seated there …. From the circle of hair
between the brows of all the illustrious buddhas who have gathered from all the buddha
fields, light now streams forth to empower the bodhisattva.1Their perfection of wisdom is
fully purified, and a spontaneous rain of the true Dharma pours down as if from massive rain-clouds
in order to make the harvests of the world’s virtue bountiful.The explanation of
the tenth resolve has thus been completed.

This was the tenth resolve from the Commentary to Entering the Middle Way.
